# StudentTrainingSuvidha
The resources that I and Srujuna Poluri created for the Student Training Program with Suvidha, in which we taught college-bound students in India many different things such as using Google applications, spoken English, and programming with Python. Srujuna and I taught the Python, which spanned 10 lessons, one each week.
